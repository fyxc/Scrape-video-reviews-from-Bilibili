# Scrape-video-reviews-from-Bilibili
It is a simple way to scrape reviews from Video in Bilibili. You can specify the search keyword, the time threshold, and the number of reviews threshold

Argument Explanation

Keyword: The word you put in the search box on the Bilibili website. This program will iterate all video exists in the searching result

Time threshold: By specifying this parameter, you can choose the time interval you would like to scrape. For instance, if I specify the threshold as '2019-03-14' in the comment func, then only the reviews posted after '2019-03-14'would be scraped.

Review threshold: In this program, I specified this number as 100. Thus, only the video which has more than 100 reviews will be scrapped
